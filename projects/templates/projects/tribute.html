  An amazing confluence of circumstances brought us here today. As I write, the
  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/coronavirus", target="_blank">
    coronavirus
    </a> is sweeping through the country, bringing life to a stand-still. As I
    work from home and eat through the canned goods and bread we bought
    in a panic, learning HTML has become a new pastime. After doing some initial
    lessons, I learned about my first project: to create a tribute page.
  </p>
<p>
    Typically, I struggle with identified the men and women I aspire to be like.
    Those who deserve our respect as individuals, as a country. That was not
    the case this time. I knew immediately who I would give this honor.
</p>
<p>Joe Exotic.</p>
<p>
    Joseph Moldonado-Passage is a man living near Wynnewood, Oklahoma. Coincidentally,
    this is less than a three-hour drive from my own hometown.
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Maldonado-Passage",

      Joe's Bio
    </a>
    speaks of a wild and vivid history. Joe continuously skirted law enforcement,
    at least for a time.
  </p>
  <p>
    Alright, I cannot continue to pretend that Joe is a role model. He has been
    convicted of
    <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/22/us/joe-exotic-sentence-oklahoma.html"
      target="_blank" id="convictions">
      murder-for-hire and various animal welfare charges
    </a>. But, I refuse to turn this simple project into a lecture about the dangers of
    minimizing such atrocious behavior in the name of entertainment. We
    need this right now. We need something trashy, something off the wall. Something
    that draws us in while making no sense whatsoever. We have chosen Joe Exotic
    as the first true meme of the crisis. So be it.
  </p>
  <p>
    So enjoy your 15 minutes, Joe Exotic. But let's stay in jail and think about
    what we did for a little longer, okay?
